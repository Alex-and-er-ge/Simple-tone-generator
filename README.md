# Simple-tone-generator
  Here is a simple Python program that generates a sine wave tone and plays it using the built-in sounddevice library. This program takes the frequency of the tone and the duration as command-line arguments.
  
  To use this program, you will need to have the sounddevice and numpy libraries installed. You can install these libraries using pip, the Python package manager:

 pip install sounddevice numpy

   To generate a tone with a frequency of 440 Hz for a duration of 1 second, you can run the program like this:

 python tone.py 440 1
